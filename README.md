# Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a movie recommendation system using machine learning.In this project, we will explore and visualize the MovieLens dataset that consists of over 10 million film ratings. We will develop an ML model by creating both training and test sets to predict movie ratings on a validation set that results in an RMSE or Root Mean Square Error of less than .87750. <br>
The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) or root-mean-square error (RMSE) is a frequently used measure of the differences between values (sample or population values) predicted by a model or an estimator and the values observed

# Dataset

GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens website ( https://movielens.org). The data sets were collected over various periods of time, depending on the size of the set. titled "MovieLens," was developed by researchers at the University of Minnesota and was designed to generate personalized film recommendations. For this project, the 10M version will be used. It contains 10 million ratings on 10,000 movies by 72,000 users. It was released in 2009.

# Steps of Analysis

* **Data Preparation** - We will load the data, split the dataset into edx and validation sets. We will then create a train and test set.
* **Data Exploration** - We will explore the data, plot histograms, create tables and graphs to observe what attributes of the dataset that affect ratings.
* **Modeling** - Once we determine the biases, we will apply these biases to our models to determine the RMSE we expect to achieve.
* **Validation** - Validate our model against the validation set
